        <h1>If only Trump had <br>played more golf</h1>

        <p>What happened when I was given a dataset of over sixteen-thousand Donald Trump tweets and told to tell a story. Well, firstly I sighed… because, like many, I have developed an acute case of TFS (trump fatigue syndrome). Symptoms are characterised by an induced state of watching the same shitty soap opera on repeat. Only to sober up and realise this is not Home and Away, this is America. </p>

        <p>So to save myself the pain of analysing his tweets in isolation, I had to branch out. And if there is one thing Trump loves more than himself, it's golf. In fact he loves it so much he made 298 visits to the golf course since his inauguration, with evidence that he teed off on over 150 of these visits. At an estimated cost for the American taxpayer, an eye-watering $146 million USD. This is all according to Trump Golf Count, a website that meticulously logs and shares the former presidents “exercise regimen”. So with a second dataset at hand, I was ready to explore the habits of a president who is “far more emotionally invested in golf than politics.” <sup>1</sup></p>

        <p>Before launching into a graph, let’s first understand a little about the data. The trump twitter dataset includes the time stamp, raw text and a sentiment analysis of each tweet. The original archive of tweets can be accessed <a href="https://trumpgolfcount.com/displayfaq" target="_blank">here</a>. The sentiment is a calculation of how positive or negative the language in the tweet is. It was calculated using TextBlob, not a perfect algorithm by any means, but accurate enough to be interesting. Below are two example tweets on either end of the sentiment spectrum.</p>

        <p>The golf count dataset includes the date, hours at the club, and whether golf was played, for any time Trump visited a location whose primary offering is golf (i.e., a “golf club). The data is sourced from White House press pool reports. You can read more about the dataset <a href="https://trumpgolfcount.com/displayfaq" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>To do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>add typical golfing hours to plot 2</li>
            <li>pos. & neg. buttons to plot 1</li>
            <li>border around plots</li>
        </ul>
